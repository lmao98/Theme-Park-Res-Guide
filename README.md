### *Theme Park Rrestaurants Guide*
#### The Customer can pick 3 different locations at the Theme Park and it will display restaurants available at given location. It also displays information about cuisine type and ratings.
Location 1 is at the Theme Park Entrance. There are two restaurants there: "Burger Queen" and a great breakfast place "IJump".
Location 2 is at the Safari Park. It also has two restaurants: "Three Amigos Tacos" and "Dairy King" Ice Cream.
Location 3 is at Magical Kingdom. We find very fancy "Mamma Mia" Stake House thre, and a lovely "Avoir Cake?" Bakery, prefect for desserts.
